### Files

**[authenticator-verbose.md](https://github.com/aeiourun/OSRS-Speedrun-Route/blob/master/authenticator-verbose.md):** Complete route notes. Recommended for learning the route.

**[authenticator-basic.md](https://github.com/aeiourun/OSRS-Speedrun-Route/blob/master/authenticator-basic.md):** Bare bones route notes. Technically contains all information needed for a run, but not for the uninitiated.

**[old-route.txt](https://github.com/aeiourun/OSRS-Speedrun-Route/blob/master/old-route.txt):** Deprecated route notes. Outdated, but neat.
